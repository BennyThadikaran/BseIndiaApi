## Example Folder
`src/examples` contains scripts that use the `BSE.py`. These are script i wrote some years back. All scripts incorporate color and fancy formatting to look good. ðŸ˜„

- **ann.py**: This is the only script i still use to date. It display all corporate announcements and corporate actions relating to your watchlist or portfolio.
    - To get started, store your watchlist symbols in a text file each symbol on a new line.
    - At first, execute `ann.py` passing the text file as an argument. `py ann.py watchlist.txt`. This will generate a `watchlist.json` file and print out all announcements and actions related to your watchlist.
    - Next time, simply execute `py ann.py` to see announcements for the day.
- **news.py**: `news.py` simply prints the last 10 announcements for a scrip.
    - Execute it as `py news.py infy`.
    - You can optionally limit the results by passing a number after the symbol.
    - `py news.py infy 3`. This returns the last 3 announcements.
- **actions.py**: `py actions.py infy` to print the recent corporate actions. Nothing more.
- **advances.py**: `py advances.py` to print the advance decline ratios for various bse Indexes.
